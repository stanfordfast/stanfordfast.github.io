On April 12, 2022, we held the 6th Annual FAST Symposium at Stanford!

![group](/assets/images/2021-22/symposium/group.jpg)

This was our first in-person symposium in three years and it was a huge success! 
FAST had 73 mentors and 34 high school students complete a total of 22 projects,
spanning topics in biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, and data science.
We had poster sessions, lab tours, student talks, and featured faculty talks from Stanford professors
Justin Du Bois (chemistry), Polly Fordyce (bioengineering), and Tobi Gerstenberg (psychology).

We are so proud of all our students, teachers, mentors, and mentor leaders whose collective work over the year made this all possible!
And we are also grateful to the stanford faculty judges, faculty speakers, and labs who volunteered their time and space for this day.
