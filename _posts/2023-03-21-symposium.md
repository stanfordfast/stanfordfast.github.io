Together, 67 mentors and 73 high school students worked on projects spanning a variety of topics in biology, chemistry, data science, engineering, and physics. A total of 43 projects were completed, many of which were showcased at the Stanford Symposium.

In addition to the poster sessions, the Symposium featured lab and campus tours and talks from FAST students and featured Stanford professors, Celeste Melamed (materials science), Tobias Gerstenberg (psychology), David Stork (computer science), Nicole Martinez (chemistry), Jane Willenbring (geologist), and Matt Jones (biology). We are incredibly grateful to the labs and faculty speakers who volunteered their time to make this day possible.
