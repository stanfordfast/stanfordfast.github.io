Thank you for supporting your child in participating in FAST! Our goal
is to provide your child with a unique opportunity to experience science
in a way that will help their community and further their career.
Our program helps students have an environment where they can work
independently or in groups on science projects. The students are then
invited to compete in science fairs and present at a Stanford Symposium
where they will meet Stanford professors and post-doctoral scholars.
You can expect your child to leave this program with a better idea of
what it will take to become a scientist or engineer and with a support
network to help them in the future. We have helped students apply to
further science opportunities. We also have written recommendations
and aided in college/financial aid applications for students who
successfully complete the program.
 
We expect teams of students or individuals (for IB students) to:
- Attend 80% of the Saturday meetings
- Saturday meetings are from 12:30 - 5:00pm
- Write a project outline and budget for experiments
- Safely perform experiments over multiple weeks
- Thoroughly analyze experimental results
- Participate in the Sciencepalooza fair and Stanford FAST symposium
 
Parents are welcome at both the Sciencepalooza event and the Stanford
FAST symposium and your participation would be much appreciated!
