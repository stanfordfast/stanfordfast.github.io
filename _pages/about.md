FAST is a program in which Stanford University graduate students mentor Future Advancers of Science and Technology (FAST) toward achieving their goals of answering open questions in science and engineering clever solutions to problems in their society. Students from Andrew P. Hill High School and James Lick High School in San Jose meet with Stanford students every other Saturday during the academic year. Between September and April, they design and execute original scientific research spanning topics in chemistry, biology, physics, engineering, and data science. Every spring, FAST students present their work at local and state science fairs and also at an annual symposium at Stanford University.
