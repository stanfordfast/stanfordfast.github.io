FAST is a program in which Stanford University graduate students mentor Future
Advancers of Science and Technology (FAST) toward achieving their goals of
answering open questions in science and engineering clever solutions to problems
in their society. Students from Andrew P. Hill High School and James Lick High
School in San Jose meet with Stanford students every other Saturday during the
academic year. Between September and April, they design and execute original
scientific research spanning topics in chemistry, biology, physics, engineering,
and data science. Every spring, FAST students present their work at local and
state science fairs and also at an annual symposium at Stanford University.
